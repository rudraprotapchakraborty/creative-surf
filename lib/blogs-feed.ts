 * A blog's published feed, newest first. Each post's byline is its writers as

 * the first writer's account picture, or the owner's when that writer has none. Shared by GET /api/blogs and the
 * server-rendered /blogs and /real-estate/blogs pages, so each arrives with
 * its posts already in the HTML.
 *
 * Returned as plain JSON values (ids and dates as strings), the same shape the
 * API has always sent, so it can be handed straight to a client component.
